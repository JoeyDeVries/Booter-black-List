# Booter (black)List
This project is an effort to collect an extensive list of Booter domain names (BDN). For such we present a Booter Classifier module that receives as input URLs and classify as true positive Booter. Although the Booter Classifier works with any URL, we develop a Booter Crawler that collects potential BDN through a systematic search on the Internet.

This research project started at the University of Twente, The Netherlands, by Jair Santanna (https://github.com/jjsantanna) with collaboration of Justyna Chromik and Joey de Vries. Would you like to join us? Clone us and keep in touch.
